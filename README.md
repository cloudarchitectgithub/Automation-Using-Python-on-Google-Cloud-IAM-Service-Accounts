## Project Description
In this real-world based project focuses on automating the management of IAM (Identity and Access Management) service accounts within Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Python. As organizations scale, managing permissions, roles, and access levels for multiple service accounts becomes increasingly complex and prone to human error. This project aims to simplify the creation, deletion, and update of IAM service accounts by automating these tasks through Python scripts, ultimately improving security and operational efficiency.

The automation solution developed in this project ensures that permissions and access levels are correctly assigned according to predefined policies. By leveraging Google Cloud APIs and the Python SDK, this project provides a systematic and repeatable way to handle IAM service accounts, making it easier to manage user access securely and consistently across the organization.

## Project Objectives
1. **Automate IAM Service Account Management**: Develop Python scripts to create, delete, and update IAM service accounts programmatically to reduce manual intervention.
2. **Enhance Security**: Ensure service accounts have only the necessary permissions, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
3. **Scalability**: Implement a scalable solution that can handle changes across multiple projects and environments.
4. **Error Handling and Logging**: Integrate robust error handling and logging mechanisms to track the success or failure of each operation, improving visibility and debugging.
5. **Cost and Resource Optimization**: Ensure efficient resource utilization by automating only necessary tasks, reducing operational overhead.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Google Cloud SDK**: Used to interact with GCP APIs and manage service accounts.
- **GCP Services**:
  - IAM (Identity and Access Management): Manage user permissions, roles, and access control.
  - Cloud Logging: Capture logs related to service account operations for monitoring and auditing.
- **APIs and Libraries**:
  - Google Cloud IAM API: Manage service accounts, roles, and permissions programmatically.
  - Google Auth and Google API Client Libraries: Authenticate and interact with GCP resources.
- **Development Environment**:
  - Cloud Shell or Local Environment: Run Python scripts directly from the GCP Cloud Shell or a local environment configured with Google Cloud SDK.

## Project Solution
1. **Initial Infrastructure Setup on GCP**
   - **Compute Resources**: Provisioned Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters to host containerized applications, offering automatic scaling to handle fluctuating traffic demands.
   - **Networking Configuration**: Configured Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks, including subnets, firewall rules, and Cloud Load Balancing, to support secure and efficient network traffic flow.
   - **DNS and SSL Setup**: Managed domain routing with Cloud DNS and SSL certificates via GCP's Certificate Manager, ensuring secure access across environments.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Automation**
   - **Source Code Management**: Used Cloud Source Repositories for version control to maintain code consistency and enable collaborative development.
   - **Build and Deployment Pipeline**: Set up Cloud Build and Cloud Deploy for CI/CD, allowing automated testing, containerization, and deployment to GKE. This ensured continuous integration and delivery for all code changes.
   - **Artifact Management**: Container images were stored in Artifact Registry, streamlining the build process and improving deployment efficiency.

3. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - **Real-Time Monitoring**: Leveraged Google Cloud Monitoring for system health insights, setting up custom dashboards to track CPU, memory, and other critical metrics in real-time.
   - **Logging and Alerts**: Configured Google Cloud Logging and alerting mechanisms to notify the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team of any anomalies, with integration into Slack for immediate communication.
   - **Synthetic Monitoring**: Implemented uptime checks using Google Cloud's synthetic monitoring to simulate user interactions and ensure consistent availability.

4. **Cost Optimization**
   - **Cost Estimation**: Used GCP's Pricing Calculator to project costs for different environments (Production, HML, Dev/Test), optimizing instance types and storage options based on requirements.
   - **Resource Optimization**: Employed Google's Sustained Use Discounts and preemptible instances for non-critical workloads, leading to significant savings in operational costs.
   - **Reserved Instances**: For stable workloads, leveraged Google's commitment-based savings to minimize expenses across compute resources.

## Prerequisites:
1. **Python 3 Installation**: Make sure Python 3 is installed. If it isn't, download and install it from Python's official website.
2. **Google Cloud SDK Installation**: Download and install the Google Cloud SDK, which provides tools to interact with Google Cloud. Search for "download Google Cloud SDK" and follow the setup steps for your OS from the official Google Cloud page.

## Step-by-Step Guide
1. **Set Up Google Cloud Service Account**:
   - Navigate to the Google Cloud Console.
   - Go to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts.
   - Create a new service account (e.g., automation-service) with the Storage Admin role to grant necessary permissions for storage operations.

<br />
<br />

   - Generate a JSON private key for this service account and save it securely on your machine. This key will authenticate your Python script.

<br />
<br />

   - This will authenticate using the JSON key and retrieve the list of storage buckets available in your Google Cloud account.

6. **Create a Storage Bucket (if none exist)**:
   - In Google Cloud Console, navigate to Cloud Storage and create a new bucket if needed. The script will list this bucket once created.
